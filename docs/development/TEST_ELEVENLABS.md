# Test Eleven Labs Integration üß™

## New "Test Voice" Button Added!

I've added a **Test Voice** button next to the Eleven Labs API key input. This will immediately test if your API key works and play a sample audio.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your Eleven Labs Key
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000
2. Paste your Eleven Labs API key in the "Eleven Labs API Key" field
3. **DON'T click "Save Keys" yet**

### Step 2: Click "Test Voice" Button
1. Click the green **"Test Voice"** button
2. Watch the message below the input field

### Step 3: Check Results

#### ‚úÖ Success (You'll see):
```
‚úÖ API key works! Playing test audio...
```

Then you'll hear:
> "Hello! This is a test of Eleven Labs text to speech."

After it finishes:
```
‚úÖ Eleven Labs working! You should have heard a test message.
```

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Your API key is valid
- ‚úÖ Eleven Labs API is working
- ‚úÖ Audio playback works in your browser
- ‚úÖ You're using Eleven Labs credits (check your account)

#### ‚ùå Common Errors:

**Error: "Please enter an Eleven Labs API key first"**
‚Üí You didn't enter anything in the field

```
‚Üí **API worked, but audio won't play**
- Check browser audio permissions
- Check system volume
- Try a different browser

## What This Tests

The test button:
1. ‚úÖ Makes a real API call to Eleven Labs
2. ‚úÖ Uses your actual API key
3. ‚úÖ **WILL use credits from your account** (about 50 characters = ~$0.0001)
4. ‚úÖ Plays actual audio in your browser
5. ‚úÖ Shows exact error if something fails

## After Test Succeeds

Once you see:
```
‚úÖ Eleven Labs working! You should have heard a test message.
```

**Then:**
1. Click "Save Keys" button (top)
2. Now your key is saved for interviews
3. Start an interview to use it automatically

## Troubleshooting with Console

### Open Console (F12)

When you click "Test Voice", you should see:

**Success:**
```

## Verify Credits Are Being Used

After a successful test:

1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io
2. Log into your account
3. Check **Usage** or **Credits**
4. You should see:
   - Character count increased by ~50
   - One API request logged
   - Recent timestamp

**If credits aren't decreasing:**
- You saw ‚úÖ but weren't actually calling the API
- Check browser Network tab (F12 ‚Üí Network)
- Look for request to `api.elevenlabs.io`
- If missing ‚Üí JavaScript error (check Console)

## Network Tab Verification

To be 100% sure the API is being called:

1. F12 ‚Üí **Network** tab
2. Clear network log
3. Click **"Test Voice"** button
4. Look for request to: `text-to-speech/EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`

**You should see:**
- **Request URL**: `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`
- **Method**: POST
- **Status**: 200
- **Type**: audio/mpeg
- **Size**: ~50 KB

Click on it to see:
- **Headers** ‚Üí Request Headers ‚Üí `xi-api-key: YOUR_KEY`

## Still Not Working?

### Copy All Diagnostic Info:

2. **Network request details** (F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Click the API call)
3. **Error message** from the page
4. **Your Eleven Labs account status** (credits remaining?)

### Common Issues:

**Issue: Key is correct but always 401**
- Copy key again (might have invisible characters)
- Try generating a brand new key
- Check account isn't suspended

**Issue: Works in test but not in interview**
- Key not saved to localStorage
- Click "Save Keys" after successful test
- Refresh page and check console logs
