# Quick Test Guide ðŸ§ª

## Test the New Split View Interface

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
mochi web
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

### 3. Setup
1. **API Key**: Enter your OpenAI key (sk-...)
2. Click "Save"

### 4. Test Problem with Symbols
Paste this problem to test symbol conversion:

```
Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- nums[i] != nums[j] when i != j
- Only one valid answer exists

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we return [0, 1].
```

### 5. Start Interview
Click "Start Interview"

### 6. What to Expect

**âœ… AI Formats Problem (1-2 seconds):**
Watch the problem transform into beautiful markdown:
- Headings for sections (Problem, Examples, Constraints)
- Bold text for important terms
- Code formatting for variables like `nums[i]`
- Lists for constraints
- Professional layout

**âœ… Coach Reads Problem Aloud:**
Listen for symbol conversions (reads ORIGINAL text, not markdown):
- "10 to the power of 4" (not "10^4")
- "nums open bracket i close bracket" (not "nums[i]")
- "not equal to" (not "!=")
- "equals" (not "==")
- **No markdown syntax spoken!** (no "asterisk asterisk")

**âœ… Split View Appears:**
- **Left Panel**: Problem Statement (beautifully formatted with markdown!)
- **Right Panel**: Your Solution (empty editor with placeholder)

**âœ… Timer Starts:**
Top left shows: 00:00 (and counting)

### 7. Test the Workflow

**A. Write Some Code:**
In the right panel (Your Solution), type:
```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
```

**B. Click "Review My Code":**
- Should send your code to coach
- Coach analyzes it (currently placeholder response)

**C. Click "Start Speaking" (if Chrome/Edge):**
- Allow microphone
- Say: "I'm using a hash map approach"
- Should transcribe and display

**D. Click "I'm Done":**
- Should trigger complexity questions

### 8. Verify Features

| Feature | Test | Expected Result |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| AI formatting | Start interview | Problem transforms to markdown (1-2s) |
| Problem visible | Start interview | Left panel shows formatted problem |
| Solution editor | Type code | Right panel accepts input |
| Symbol reading | Listen to coach | Hears "to the power of" not "caret" |
| No markdown in speech | Listen to coach | No "asterisk asterisk" spoken |
| Code review | Click button | Uses editor content, no prompt |
| Split view | Resize window | Panels stay side-by-side (or stack on mobile) |
| Timer | Wait 1 minute | Shows 01:00 |

### 9. Mobile Test (Optional)

Open on phone (Chrome on Android works best):
1. Should see stacked layout (vertical)
2. Problem on top, solution below
3. Voice should work with "Start Speaking"

### 10. Symbol Conversion Test

To specifically test symbol conversion, paste:
```
Power of Two

Given n, return true if n == 2^x where x >= 0

Constraints: -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
```

Listen for:
- "2 to the power of x"
- "2 to the power of 31 minus 1"

## Troubleshooting

**Problem not reading aloud?**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Ensure browser supports Speech Synthesis
- Check system volume

**Split view not showing?**
- Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
- Check browser width (needs > 768px for side-by-side)

**Code review not working?**
- Make sure you have code in solution editor
- Check WebSocket connection (status indicator)

**Symbols not converting?**
- This is a speech feature only
- Text display shows original symbols
- Listen to audio for converted speech

## Success Criteria

âœ… **AI formats problem** into beautiful markdown (1-2 seconds)
âœ… Coach reads **original text** aloud with symbol conversion
âœ… **No markdown spoken** (no "asterisk asterisk")
âœ… Problem statement visible on left at all times with formatting
âœ… Solution editor visible on right at all times
âœ… Can write code while seeing problem
âœ… Review button uses solution editor content
âœ… Timer tracks elapsed time
âœ… Chat shows conversation history
